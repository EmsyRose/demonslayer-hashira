  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>Tengen is an eccentric and flashy individual, always wanting to be "flamboyant", possessing a need for everything to be flashy and outstanding, even proclaiming that he is the god of flashiness and festivals.</p>
  <p>As a result of his exuberant and flamboyant personality, Tengen is very demanding of others, treating the Demon Slayers very harshly during Hashira Training and insulting them for having no substance when they couldn't survive his stamina training.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, he also abhors the idea of unflashy things, as shown when the Hashira openly expresses his hate for plainness.</p>

  <h2>Quotes</h2>
  <p>"Do I look like someone with any talent? [...] See, this country is vast. It's teeming with people who'd blow your mind. Some are complete enigmas. Some can take up a sword and become a Hashira in two months. Me, chosen? Don't give me that crap! Just how many lives do you think I've let slip through my fingers until now?"</p>
  <p>"I'm the one who should be grateful. Master, for your sake, I'd never think twice about laying down my life. I can surely accomplish everything. Those who have baggage like conflict or quandaries are spineless fools. That's always been the story of my life."</p>
  <p>"I am a god! You three are trash! That's the first thing you need to pound into your heads! Drive it in! You're to turn into dogs if I tell you to! Turn into monkeys if I say so! Hunch over and rub your hands together, constantly pander to my every whim and suck up to me with every fiber of your being! And let me repeat! I am a god!"</p>
