  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>Muichiro is an air-headed individual who seems to constantly wander off in thought and is unable to focus on anything.</p>
  <p>Impassive and, at times, obtuse, he tends to think only for himself and operates on logic alone, never letting emotions guide him, making him seem seemingly apathetic and indifferent.</p>
  <p>Despite his mostly uncaring and unserious demeanor, he has been shown to become serious when it is required and is intensely devoted to his position as the Demon Slayer Corps' Mist Hashira.</p>
  <p>However, before the death of his twin brother when the siblings were eleven, Muichiro's personality was that of a much more compassionate and optimistic individual, the polar opposite of his current disposition.</p>
  <p>Having originally taken after his father, he was shown to display a higher level of kindness and understanding, believing he should aim to do good for others if he wanted good to be done for him.</p>
  <p>When told by Amane Ubuyashiki that they were descendants to Demon Slayers of old, Muichiro became excited at the prospect of being able to protect people.</p>
  <p>After his brother was attacked by a demon and witnessing his final moments and death, Muichiro subsequently lost his memories and has held a perpetual rage deeply suppressed inside of him that inevitably drove his future, intense training.</p>
  <p>After this memory loss, he started exhibiting the indifferent attitude of his twin brother he is now known for as a Hashira, becoming hostile, aloof, and unbothered by the opinions of others.</p>

    <h2>Quotes</h2>
    <p>"Have you been trained to withstand torture? Even most adults can't endure it, so it's impossible that you could. You appear to be an exceedingly dumb brat. So what if it does break? Why not make it again? While you're rattling on and on and on and on with your nonsense, do you know how many people will die? That's what it means to interfere with a Hashira. Your time and a Hashira's time have completely different value. If you used your head just a little, you would understand. [...] So come on, the key! Know your place in life and act accordingly. Because you aren't a baby."</p>
    <p>"Just like master said, if you recover your confidence... you can dig in with both feet and use your full strength. If you know who you are then no demon can run when you bring down a blade that knows no hesitation or confusion."</p>
    <p>"Even the strongest attacks are pointless if they don't hit."</p>
    <p>"Remember that boiling anger. [...] Even if I lose my memories, my body will remember that anger that will not leave me until I die. It's why I trained so hard that I vomited blood to destroy demons. And more... to eradicate them!"</p>
    <p>"As for the reason I was born, I know that full well. I was born to be happy. [...] I was happy when we lived as a family. When I was alone, there were many hard and painful things, but then... I made friends and there were good times, so I was able to smile again. There were countless moments where I thought I was happy. Was that not enough? I didn't turn my eyes away or run from anything. I don't regret risking my life for my comrades."</p>
    <p>"Thank you too. Thanks to you, I got back something important."</p>
