  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>Obanai is a very harsh and strict individual who shows no concern for those who do not abide by the rules of the Demon Slayer Corps.</p>
  <p>Obanai has a rather prominent habit of pointing at people with his finger in an accusatory manner while berating them or talking badly about someone.</p>
  <p>Obanai is also noted to possess an immense sense of self-loathing due to the fact that he was born to a selfish and immoral clan who would mercilessly sacrifice even newborn children to a demon for their own monetary gain.</p>
  <p>Obanai considers himself and his family so tainted that years after they were killed, he still felt as if his family were digging their nails into his skin to make sure he couldn't go anywhere.</p>
  <p>He even goes as far as to believe that, in order for him to ever be worthy of Mitsuri, he would first have to die and cleanse himself of his corrupted blood before confessing his feelings to her.</p>
  <p>His upbringing also seems to be the cause of his gynophobia since he was born into a family of only women who treated him like a tool.</p>
  <p>The trauma of his past can also be seen in the form of his facial bandages that he dons to cover the terrible scars he received, never removing it until the final battle.</p>
  <p>In addition to the horrible treatment he received from his family, of being treated as a mere tool and sacrifice, Obanai was deeply affected by the words of resentment and hatred from his only surviving cousin when she said that the entire family died simply because he ran away.</p>
  <p>Although he recognized that her grudge and words were illogical, he chose to accept that he was at fault and even considered himself as corrupt as his family was, believing he was not worthy to live a normal life.</p>
  <p>This shows that despite the various unpleasant traits of his personality, Obanai actually has a conscience and morals, unlike his family.</p>

  <h2>Quotes</h2>
  <p>"I want to die defeating Muzan, and I pray that it will purify my filthy blood. Then, if I am reborn as a human being in a peaceful world without demons, I will tell you of my feelings for you."</p>
  <p>"One second... dawn feels so far away... so to even buy one second, everyone in the Demon Slayer Corps is sacrificing their lives! Defeat is unforgivable. It is absolutely unforgivable to waste the lives of our comrades who protected us."</p>
