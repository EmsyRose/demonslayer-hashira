  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>Mitsuri is a very emotional, passionate, and jovial individual who constantly compliments and swoons over her comrades in her head, likely a contributing factor towards her nickname as "the Hashira of Love."</p>
  <p>Although she can be shy and is easily flustered, Mitsuri is always kind to others.</p>
  <p>However, despite her gentle and seemingly innocent demeanor, Mitsuri will show no mercy in the face of demons, instead expressing such sentiments with a fierce tone.</p>
  <p>She showcases a great amount of dedication to the Demon Slayers' cause.</p>
  <p>Despite being put out of commission by Muzan at an early stage in their battle, she was determined enough to return and fight.</p>

  <h2>Quotes</h2>
  <p>"My heart would never flutter for those who needlessly hurt others!"</p>
  <p>"Is it okay for a girl to be this strong? I still worry that someone may ask that, as though I'm not human. In my fear, I was suppressing my strength. But not anymore. Leave this to me. I will protect everyone."</p>
  <p>"I remember now! I was searching for a worthy man... But I was also searching for a place to be myself! I must be flexible... and lithe. I must be more like myself. What should I do, Rengoku? At a time like this, I... I can't stop... my heart from pounding!"</p>
