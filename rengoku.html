  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>Kyojuro was greatly enthusiastic in regard to his duties as a Hashira, and often came across as cheerfully eccentric.</p>
  <p>He was amiable, pure of heart, and boasted extraordinary technique and swordsmanship stemming from strict practice and discipline.</p>
  <p>He was an honorable warrior who adhered to his code of morals and principles that was instilled into him by his mother at a young age; the most significant being his belief that those who were born strong have a duty to protect the weak.</p>

  <h2>Quotes</h2>
  <p>"However, if you bare your fangs at innocent people, my bright red flame blade will burn you to the bone!"</p>

  <p>"Even without admiration... I will fight to protect people from demons. That's what we do! It may seem pitiful... But I will fulfil my duty!"</p>

  <p>"Growing old and dying is what gives meaning and beauty to the fleeting span of a human life. It's precisely because we age and die that our lives have value and nobility. Strength is not a word that means much in regard to the flesh."</p>

  <p>"Go ahead and live with your head held high. No matter how devastated you may be by your own weakness or uselessness, set your heart ablaze. Grit your teeth and look straight ahead. Even if you stop and crouch down, time won't wait for you or snuggle you and grieve along with you. Don't feel bad that I'm going to die here. As a Hashira, of course I would shield my juniors."</p>

  <p>"Life is a series of decisions. You never have unlimited options or unlimited time to think, but what you choose in that instant defines who you are. Warriors who strive to save other people's lives are precious. Their pure and single-minded dedication is separate from their natural talent. They don't risk their lives to earn praise. They simply feel that they must. What they choose in that moment, is a cry from the depths of their souls. Isn't that right... my friends?"</p>
