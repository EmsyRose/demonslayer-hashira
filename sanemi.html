  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>Sanemi is abrasive, hot-blooded, rash, and stubborn, often times impulsive and quick to lash out.</p>
  <p>He is often indifferent towards others and can get angry extremely easily.</p>
  <p>Sanemi has also displayed a hunger for battle, wishing that he could encounter Upper Rank demons and proclaiming his excitement in fighting Upper Rank One, Kokushibo</p>
  <p>Sanemi's cold, rude, and dismissive behavior is the result of losing too many people he cared about in the past.</p>
  <p>Because of all those he lost to them, Sanemi harbors a deep hatred towards demons and is convinced that humans and demons can never coexist.</p>
  <p>When he makes up his mind about something, it is extremely difficult to dissuade him.</p>
  <p>Despite his poor treatment of his brother, Genya, Sanemi truly did love and care for his brother, admitting that he blames himself for not protecting him.</p>

  <h2>Quotes</h2>
  <p>"That's right! And that wind... is going to wrench off your head!"</p>
  <p>"Why do you think I went so far as to kill our mother? To protect you. You should have had a house somewhere and raised a family and grow old. To make up for what I couldn't do for mother and our little brothers and little sisters, you should have had a wife and children and made them happy. And I would've never let a demon get near you."</p>
  <p>"I know how unfair the world is... because good people... die one after another."</p>
